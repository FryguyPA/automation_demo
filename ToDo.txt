My to do list

Create master list of output and place in text file using columns or something
figure it out - interfaces will be the fun one :)


Next demos:

Need to do a compare of configs - pull running, do the deploy , compare and report differences


Look at what PyTest can do - that is making waves at Cisco for some stuff


Demo 2:

Yaml
Jinja2

Build BGP peering with ISP router and validate network
Using Pyats to compare before/after to see changes
Can we use this to test/validate other confings?


pyats create testbed interactive --output testbed.yml --encode-password

genie learn all --testbed-file inventory.yml --output pre_change

genie learn all --testbed-file inventory.yml --output post_change

genie diff pre_change post_change --output diff_change
